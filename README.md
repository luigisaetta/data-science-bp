This repo will contains a set of best practices and examples for a successful adoption of **Data Science**

Some of these examples are based on **OCI DataScience Cloud Service** (https://www.oracle.com/it/data-science/service/).

Some other examples are more general.

## Features
* How to compute basic stats for a dataset
* [How-to](https://github.com/luigisaetta/data-science-bp/blob/main/eda_hist.ipynb) easily ploy hystograms of features using Seaborn and Matplotlib: 
* Usage of [**ocifs**](https://github.com/luigisaetta/data-science-bp/blob/main/ocifs1.ipynb) for easy access to OCI **Object Storage**
* plot a [**Correlation Matrix**](https://github.com/luigisaetta/data-science-bp/blob/main/correlation_heatmap.ipynb) as an **HeatMap** using **Seaborn**
* How to check if **GPU** support is working
* How to do [**K-fold Cross Validation**](https://github.com/luigisaetta/data-science-bp/blob/main/how_to_kfold_cv.ipynb)
